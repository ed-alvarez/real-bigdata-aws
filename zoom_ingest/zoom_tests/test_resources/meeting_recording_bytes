How are you? Good morning! Good. You\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:43.769\r\nNicolas Verle: Very good, very good. Thank you. I'm sorry i'm still struggling with my camera. This is killing me every time it works and then stops working. I think you're gonna have to ask for a new one, because it's It's insane. How have you been\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.190\r\nMei Mei Chow: good? I had a break with the family in the timing for a week. That was really really nice.\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.029\r\nNicolas Verle: I'm sure venture.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.920\r\nMei Mei Chow: Did you go? So did you? Did you go selling, or you just went to the beach?\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.759\r\nMei Mei Chow: This one's a beach. So we've been sailing in Fouquet before. Ah, just I call it Bc. Right before before children, and we found there was no\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.590\r\nMei Mei Chow: So we we divide our lives from, you know, Bbc: or after So A:\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.899\r\nNicolas Verle: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:31.830\r\nMei Mei Chow: So when you were young, free and single, we yeah, we went sailing for a week and realized there was absolutely No, we get lots of waves for no wind. So so this time it was just an onshore beach holiday in a villa with a nice pool. There was a\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:51.250\r\nMei Mei Chow: um. There's a chef who Ah, um! The villa has a has your own chef, so you know you just ordered the food in my class. Are you? So? Yeah, I I think I've put on this three. Kg: So welcome to my world. We'll do that.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.040\r\nMei Mei Chow: So you won't, you won't. You won't put it.\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.120\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, I wouldn't forget it was it was um we're meeting with my husband's\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:19.459\r\nMei Mei Chow: um sister and family, and some of them flew in from Uk, and some flew in from India, where his brother-in-law is um working for one of the oil companies Exxon. So we had to choose an island that we knew had sun, but at the same time there was a direct flight. So yeah,\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.369\r\nMei Mei Chow: all the yeah. So it's good.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.489\r\nMei Mei Chow: Get it. I actually see you.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:38.199\r\nMei Mei Chow: The food is so I don't know It's great. For ten years. Ten years ago, actually with some friends, I spent two weeks selling around croquet. We were on to a forty-five ship selling selling boats. That was great it was great you're selling topics all around it,\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:50.490\r\nMei Mei Chow: and one of my best memory ever I need to come back. But as you said, that was Pc: I was uh, that was actually what i'm gonna say to. Oh, not ten years ago, twenty years ago. Oh, my God!\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:02.730\r\nMei Mei Chow: That's two thousand and two! That's two thousand and twelve. My oldest is already born, but I've always thought of myself. I gotta go back there. Yeah, go by there. It's so beautiful\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:23.070\r\nMei Mei Chow: that you saw you found some wind then, because when we when we went. We did Fouquet. Ah, probably no wind the only bit that was win. Ah, we had, Mona. How ah of about, I think. Fifty foot right. The only bit of wind we found was from between as we were crossing over to P. P.\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:36.490\r\nNicolas Verle: So let me um. We actually have done that into ah December, and we went all around the north. What's the name of these islands? Similar N. Islands\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.490\r\nMei Mei Chow: sit down\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.319\r\nMei Mei Chow: So when all way north to Simeon Island,\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:04:10.050\r\nMei Mei Chow: and and then we had some. I remember actually having a you know how to say when you're on duty like for two or three hours a night, and that, like huge storm raining everywhere, it was great. It was great, great, great, great, of course, the lost side. All the fence I did that was for so long, but i'll I'll definitely come back to it. It's already late for you, so I don't want. I want to be used to too much of your time.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:22.989\r\nNicolas Verle: I'm sorry for my camera. It's still not working, but I'm. Uh I I did receive directly from Jason. Thanks very much. The analysis of the uh the serial transaction. I think it's\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.029\r\nNicolas Verle: it's great. Did he actually do the math? If if other things equal what it would mean for us, adjusting for the backlog, you know, if you take sixty-seven million per steel, and you're adding the backlog what it would mean for us.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:54.079\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, it comes to about um. I think when you did the backl, it it comes to about eighty-ish um and Arctic. Ah, Stan, from I think the the same. Ah, but except Arctic thought that the steel value was higher.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.669\r\nMei Mei Chow: So, in interesting. I don't know whether it's because things have moved. You know, that deal with\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.990\r\nMei Mei Chow: and which you that is about\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.989\r\nNicolas Verle: Yeah, here you're talking about the steel value of the Cdo jackups. Right?\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:24.320\r\nNicolas Verle: Okay, that. But but because if I got that right, it's one hundred million all in per jackup, including including the backlog. So if you strip the backlog out, then you're between seventy and eighty million.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:38.959\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah. So but what I remember is, if we take seventy to eighty million steel for our rigs, our own wrecks, and then you add the backdrop that we have. We're in about one hundred and ten hundred and twenty, eight hundred and thirty.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.230\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.819\r\nMei Mei Chow: So we're talking about\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.750\r\nMei Mei Chow: to add about,\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.180\r\nMei Mei Chow: I think, twenty to thirty per week\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.789\r\nNicolas Verle: in terms of Butler.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.590\r\nNicolas Verle: Okay.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.530\r\nNicolas Verle: Okay. So So somewhat somewhat somewhat equivalent. All right. Look, I mean It's It's good.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.460\r\nNicolas Verle: I'm: Sure it's It's It's pretty helpful.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.309\r\nMei Mei Chow: Ah, what\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:26.019\r\nMei Mei Chow: what was interesting because it was a you know Stan objects been knocking on our door. So, as I was saying to Ben as well that they've been. They've been asking whether they could do anything for us right. And um, I I said to access. Well, well, if you think there's such a great market for for for for asset purchase. Why haven't come to us before?\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:37.319\r\nMei Mei Chow: And they looked a bit sheepish, maybe because they didn't. I don't know who they asked, but they said, Well, we were given the impression that none of the rigs were for sale.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.339\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah. So I said, that's not the case. And and clearly\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:50.260\r\nMei Mei Chow: that must have been the impression, because otherwise they could have come and hooked out our things to ads as well. Right?\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:07:03.170\r\nMei Mei Chow: Um, But so I I put them right. I said no such thing. I said everything was on the table, so they said they were going to go away, and and and you know, come back, I think, this week to to tell me what they think there is in the market.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.990\r\nNicolas Verle: It's\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:14.079\r\nMei Mei Chow: good good we want. We want options, as we said, you know it's we. We want an exit sooner sooner than later.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:33.999\r\nMei Mei Chow: And uh, obviously, if we have to celebrate by rig, at least that's even something we can do before solving the tax thing, because we're selling an asset after we just don't want to make sure we have enough to solve the tax thing. But whereas if you're selling the overall business, then you need to sold the tax thing before setting the overall business.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:07:34.420 --> 00:08:04.349\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yes, I mean when I was saying that, he said He doesn't hold up much hope for C. Max to see much of value of how i'm getting too much money back until the tax issue is this result? And uh, whilst I I know that that's hanging over us, I feel that we still have to progress with everything at the same time and see what comes up, so that you know, as soon as the tax thing is resolved, or we say, even if we do, ssl we are ready. We're rather than wait\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.090\r\nMei Mei Chow: for the texting to be resolved.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:20.399\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, I I I I I I I also don't want you to, You know, burn burn them. They like all too much. Uh, and and if you have to prioritize, because if you have it's almost impossible to conduct everything in parallel,\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:38.880\r\nNicolas Verle: so it's it's It's It's true that the tax thing is sort of first and foremost, I actually do. You think if we start with that's actually brainstorm? If we start selling one, two rigs directly as an asset sale. Obviously, gemax is going to be unhappy right? Because it means that's a ray which is moving east\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:55.930\r\nNicolas Verle: one way or another. Do you think they could have indirectly or bad influence on whatever negotiation we're having with the Mexican taxman? I even X picks up the phone and call their friends with the Ssd. Saying, These guys, you know they just did something nasty to us, or you think it's two different two different things.\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.530\r\nMei Mei Chow: Um,\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:11.419\r\nMei Mei Chow: I don't know I I I would say I don't know Mexican well enough to know that. But um! I I think there is that risk that that would happen.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:30.789\r\nMei Mei Chow: Um, which means, I think you know that's why. If we have those options available, we will. We will have to go back to come and say, Are you serious? Otherwise, when we'll sell the rigs and give them that option to extend things for a longer period, and then we we, so they support block.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:39.790\r\nMei Mei Chow: Um. It's just that You can see the Middle Eastern guys are picking up any spare steel at the moment. That's something else we need to consider.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:56.180\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, No, Clearly, Clearly it's. Ah, what will we do? Everything we we do, everything one go, then, then there's less concern, Right? It's It's a that you say we're stripping out one by one or Pmx and turn around and say, Okay, fine.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.849\r\nMei Mei Chow: And then we'll be pouring them.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:24.589\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, I I. I just want to make sure that we're not. Obviously it's great that we show in peace to remix. I think the next understand that the balance of power is massively changed, not only because of our behavior, because, whatever everything that's happening, I just want to. On the other hand, I don't want to Pmx in a corner where they're so bad at us that they pick up the phone and they call their friends the sat and say, just that slip their throat open.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.450\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay,\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:44.569\r\nMei Mei Chow: and I may. Maybe they have the power. Maybe they don't. Maybe they won't. Do it. But so look I I I leave it to you. You you know you know where I stand. I want events as much as possible, but the reality is where I grew up. The first event on Cmx is the tax we need to deal with the\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.690\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yes, so maybe i'll let me update you without giving you the numbers right.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:11:00.540\r\nMei Mei Chow: Let me up you to where we've got to. So I think. As I spoke to you, I said, I insist on a call with Kpmg last Friday, which we had,\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.140\r\nMei Mei Chow: and um\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:13.379\r\nMei Mei Chow: good and bad. Sadly, I think the conclusion that Jim myself and Ken as came to was Kpmg's report\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:31.109\r\nMei Mei Chow: was not so strong as in they Haven't done as much work as Shabbat has in a shorter time and more confidence in their answers, but saying that Kpmg's numbers were\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.730\r\nMei Mei Chow: closer to Chavers, so we have unsigned. On one side we have got chavers,\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:53.309\r\nMei Mei Chow: and then Kpmg. Which gives us, and saying to Jim, at least the comfort that Chaves was not talking rubbish. Chevy's number is very clear, and Gibb and he has taken an even dimmer view. So we're talking about large numbers just for one year.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:23.409\r\nMei Mei Chow: So um. Then that was a debate on whether you know we retain Kpmg. Their work isn't uh not as strong, and I said, we need to retain them. They are an international firm after all, and eventually we will push them to come up with a formal opinion, and if we are going to go down the litigation route, or at least show teeth in the negotiations to education, will be much stronger\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.339\r\nMei Mei Chow: by two tech advisors rather than one.\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:40.340\r\nMei Mei Chow: So what we're doing with Kpmg now is pushing them to come to a more concrete view by this Friday,\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:58.579\r\nMei Mei Chow: where we've got to, and I don't. I don't know whether it is them not getting enough information, or they don't want to get enough information. They're still a bit blurry on twenty, sixteen onwards, but we've got enough viewpoint\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:17.700\r\nMei Mei Chow: on the two thousand and fourteen to know that two thousand and sixteen is going to go the same way. It's just a matter of how much more we're going to add to the to the numbers, as we've only over the years. Right? So let me make sure. I understand right now. Two thousand and fourteen is the one for which we have number two thousand and fifteen. They've passed the statutory time limit,\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:22.000\r\nNicolas Verle: so after it's a question of two thousand and sixteen, and we don't know where it stops.\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:33.140\r\nMei Mei Chow: Correct. Two thousand and sixteen and seventeen are in the middle of assessments, and then you've got eighteen, nineteen, twenty, and eventually twenty one, which\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.909\r\nMei Mei Chow: which they haven't issue any assessment, and they may do\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.190\r\nMei Mei Chow: um. So so\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:14:01.769\r\nMei Mei Chow: so I um. This was a strategy here I was discussing with uh, Jim and and I just wanted to share with you and also get more ideas on how we should progress forward. Um, I said to Jim. Okay, we now really need to engage with him. Manual. We we can't we? We can't delay that anymore. And uh,\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:21.609\r\nMei Mei Chow: also Quin Emmanuel reached out to me over the weekend. They've just been offered another litigation against Cedril um Bill, The the medicine partner, did not want to have too much information, because he didn't want to be,\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:40.859\r\nMei Mei Chow: you know, conflicted uh. So he told them not to give him more information until he's spoken to to to me to to say we may. Uh, Are you okay? If we go? Yeah, basically we we gotta. We gotta to decide what We' in the option.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:15:03.499\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yes, uh, but luckily, a day later I said to him: I said, Bill, at least get some information to see whether this this mitigation against C drill is on other things, or is it to do with the S that since past the Paris? He says he thinks from what he's getting it's got nothing to do with with the assets that's been moved to Paris, so he's\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:16.610\r\nMei Mei Chow: i'm quite confident there's no conflict. However, I was saying to Jim, I said, I don't want to lose his opportunity of getting a Quin Emmanuel and find that they're not acting me as a side and sending me, you know.\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:33.610\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah. So So Jim is now agreed that we need to appoint them. Uh. So I've spoken to to Bill and say, Hold your horses over there we are. We are appointing you um, and he is just going to give me a refresh engagement that gave me dates back to,\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.210\r\nMei Mei Chow: I think,\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:45.990\r\nMei Mei Chow: June, or maybe before June. It is too old, so he's going to have to re. We craft it right? So that's where we are with Quid Emmanuel\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.010\r\nMei Mei Chow: at least first stage. The first stage is to review all the documentation, everything they need to do to see whether we have a case.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.589\r\nNicolas Verle: Yup, yup, yup! And and and where. So what\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:20.900\r\nNicolas Verle: understood and agreed We need to, you know, purchase thing out. We we ced real the other, as I, As we discussed for for us the priority was to take care of the C next notes it's It's mostly done now. So now it's. The next thing on cmx. Is this tax issue so obviously dealing with the sat one and then dealing with cedar. On the other hand, when when do you think we are going to start engaging with the S at?\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:34.589\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay. So this is the pros and cons right? Um. Ah, my view is, we need Chavez involved cachevest's. Ah! Analysis is much much stronger than Kpmg. So we have two\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:17:03.530\r\nMei Mei Chow: text advisors behind us. We have win in that role, and my view is after you. You have met to Pesus, and the fact that he has has delivered to date. Uh, he says he can engage with the S. Eighteen is to also involve uh Rda and Hastes in this. But this is where the chicken and it comes in if we know, before engaging the sat, it's a large number. We know that now that should be the numbers that we use.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:28.290\r\nMei Mei Chow: Uh, If you know, Bill finds that we have a good case of either gross negligence or or misconduct whatever procedure side to, to basically use it to negotiate to get something back from the right here, either the money or the shares, and so on. So forth. Um, if we go and speak to sat first, and then he sues is\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:47.970\r\nMei Mei Chow: uh he's confident that he can reduce that number to very small. It's almost like we've got nothing to negotiate with, C drill, anymore. So it's It's It's How do we get haste to get uh sat to slow down uh until we have a proper case?\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:53.589\r\nMei Mei Chow: Uh go through that with C drill before we then formally engage sat.\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.959\r\nNicolas Verle: Yeah. Look\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:18:11.810\r\nNicolas Verle: I I I see. Yeah, but with okay, I I understand the theoretical question. But i'm afraid we can't have a cake and eat it. We can, on one hand, obtain a lot from cedar on the page. Now, in the end, whatever we get from cedar will be\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.070\r\nNicolas Verle: that that's that will be a\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:33.189\r\nNicolas Verle: based on whatever we're being finally hit by the taxman. What I what I mean by that is, if i'm ced well, there is no way, no way in in hell that I will ever accept to settle before I know what's the final impact to Paris.\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:19:02.160\r\nMei Mei Chow: See what I mean. There's there's no way. I I just want to bury that thing quickly, and it's, you know. I'm i'm. I'm inventing stupid numbers on purpose. Let's say that we start seeing how it's two hundred million impact for us, and we're going to say it's two hundred million. Okay, So we're suing your basis of two hundred million. Well, the same time we negotiate one main to end up being only fifty million per day. There is no way in hell,\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:19.789\r\nMei Mei Chow: and a serial will ever accept to negotiate before they know what's the final number we're being hit with. So I think my once again I don't want to micromanage you. I I leave it to your to your decision. But by playing the the chicken leg\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:39.019\r\nNicolas Verle: in the end we're now going to accelerate things which is going to delay things. Because if I were to say sorry guys, I i'm not even engaging with you. I'm not negotiating before you. Actually, if you know, maybe you could just be inventing stupid numbers, right? Maybe you guys, I And by the way, that's what i'll say, because i'll say that for me there was no tax issue.\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:55.929\r\nMei Mei Chow: So show me you're actually paying something, because once we're paying something by definition, we don't want to pay something for being something, because we feel we have no choice. So I think the priority is, we engage with the sat. We we sort of park in our mind.\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.679\r\nNicolas Verle: Whatever is that we'll recover from cedral.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:07.739\r\nNicolas Verle: We agree on a scheduled payment, whatever we find as much as we can to lower it. Once we've got that then we turn to cetera.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.330\r\nI would think so.\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.689\r\nMei Mei Chow: Otherwise. It's too easy to facilitate to say these. These are virtual numbers that are corresponding to nothing.\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:29.300\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, I hear an interest. And the other thing we just need to be um cognizant about is they want to push for E. Why, whom they say they can get them twenty million. So that's the other thing that\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:41.189\r\nMei Mei Chow: do. We then allow them to go with Ei and let them take their responsibility, or we go with someone else and not use the Ui and end up with a high number, and then they're going to turn around and say, Well,\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.060\r\nMei Mei Chow: okay.\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:20:43.110 --> 00:21:00.100\r\nMei Mei Chow: But the problem is, I I see what you're describing. But if we let Cedial drive the ship, it will go nowhere. Nothing will happen, because deep inside, even though they always they will always pretend that how we use the Ui would have been a lot lower.\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:06.740\r\nNicolas Verle: The truth is, if we let them drive that ship with Ei, we will get to nowhere in a year and a half, which is not something you can afford,\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:24.359\r\nNicolas Verle: so it's not a question of us saying, we're We're building a file, and not to try to see why I was, was frankly and maybe not in fraud, but in roles, misunderstanding at least negligence. So in one hand we're showing the negligence by Ui, the negligence, by cedarl into telling me why, what to do,\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:29.680\r\nNicolas Verle: and we justifying why we're moving away from you. Why, and then\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:56.219\r\nNicolas Verle: then we nigger, and then we negotiate with the tax plan, and Cedral will never be able to say that we negotiate with the tax plan in in bad phase, because whatever we recover from them will only be a fraction right? So we had all incentive to try to get that. We got to show that we're trying to get that number as low as possible. But if we, if we let cedral at the hem with you, I I can assure you we'll still be discussing about this in a year.\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.910\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, which is we? Just um,\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:17.629\r\nMei Mei Chow: And I I think that's what we've done till now right to make sure that we are comfortable with what an independent findings are, rather than leave it to run it and sign everything off. I think we just got to be triply sure. Legally, they can't come and hit us with it.\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.050\r\nMei Mei Chow: Look at Jim,\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:38.109\r\nMei Mei Chow: we we are! We are sovereign in our company now, right, that's us taking the decision so normally. If shares in you have done their work well, there's enough in their work to show that e why Job, which is not to do in the first place.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:47.270\r\nMei Mei Chow: So we should just build that audit trail summ in that to cedar and say we've decided to remove a y for a B C, and D.\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.370\r\nMei Mei Chow: Now we'll we'll keep you in form of the negotiation.\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.089\r\nNicolas Verle: We're always at every point in time we keep them in full.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.000\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay,\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:03.869\r\nMei Mei Chow: they can race and they can't raise their hand. But we got to show what what how many mistakes Ai has been doing so.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.050\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah.\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:28.269\r\nMei Mei Chow: Otherwise you know it's it is. This sort of mitigation cannot be handled by cedar. It's a complete conflict of interest you. You'll be doing with people procedural Don't care. They're not shoulder or they will keep the can down the road forever, And that's where our interest is not online. We want to deal with that thing as a asap.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.460\r\nThey want to never have to deal with that thing.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:42.730\r\nMei Mei Chow: So even if there's a I understand the cost to us all. We can legal risk. But you know, lawyers how they are. They see risk everywhere. Okay, fine. But I know what my biggest risk for me is nothing happening for you.\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.130\r\nMei Mei Chow: It's\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.140\r\nMei Mei Chow: okay. I hear you. Um!\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:56.789\r\nMei Mei Chow: It just makes you all the I I'll just make sure all the ends are tied. That's anything concerns me. But no, I do.\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.239\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, I I mean, I am.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:06.540\r\nMei Mei Chow: I can see you now. Yeah, yeah. Finally, I don't know how long it's gonna last up. But it's there.\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:13.990\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, Our confidence level is definitely with Travis and Rda and Quid Manual. Right? It's just to\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:30.800\r\nMei Mei Chow: yeah, and you and and and we need a big name like Atm G. To be able to fight off you. Why? Because the Y. C. Door will have a feel, they say, Oh, but you hire the local guy. It's not the international standard. Blah blah blah blah blah! We hire the local diagnosed best. We had a great firm, and both of them. I told us\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.489\r\nNicolas Verle: Job done by Ai was not up to the required standard boom.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:43.999\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay, that gives us a way forward, because I hear you. Okay?\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.889\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay. And you what you wanted to discuss with me. Also this thing about sergio relocation expenses\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:18.540\r\nMei Mei Chow: for that. That was so that so there are two things on Serjo. Um. So I think when Keenan sporting was doing the cusp escape or cascade um, and we are trying to get uh Tina all the direct to ships right and and get all the people off. Uh, we've found out that uh, because it was all done on a piecemeal basis that's\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:24.780\r\nMei Mei Chow: is sitting in the middle. I would call the\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:42.789\r\nMei Mei Chow: in the middle, holding companies, so he's not sitting in the Mexican, c. Max companies. He's not sitting at the top layer parrot. But he's sitting in these C Mix companies in Uk, Netherlands and Hoskly Bermuda.\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.930\r\nNicolas Verle: You mean he's already there as of today. He's already a director there. Okay, Okay,\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.789\r\nMei Mei Chow: yeah. So he he was a director, and I think either\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.450\r\nMei Mei Chow: two or three companies what I call the intermediate holding companies.\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:57.820\r\nMei Mei Chow: Now.\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.310\r\nMei Mei Chow: I uh\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:13.790\r\nMei Mei Chow: obviously sympathize with him. He doesn't want to go on a Mexican entities because of the text issue. He says he doesn't want to be son. He pulled into jail, but he's Ah,\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:34.779\r\nMei Mei Chow: um! So so that's the main reason he doesn't want to be there. So when King is building brought it to Uh Tyson myself, James and Jim the other day, and said, What do you want to do with sergio because he's in between. So we all have a discussion to say it doesn't make sense right for him to be in either all the way through or he's not at all.\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:47.169\r\nMei Mei Chow: So that was. It was just logically what we came to. So Jordan did say to me, What did the Board deliberate? And I was very open with him. I say, look, this is concerned. If you were a Mexican director,\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:26:47.180 --> 00:27:08.339\r\nMei Mei Chow: then it makes sense for you to be all the way through. But you're neither on top, and you're not at the bottom, and you're just in the intermediate holding company where there's no real activity. And then he said he would want it to request that he stayed on there because he said the Board Director ship's reported to him. He did mention that he had had a discussion with you, and I said\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:21.930\r\nMei Mei Chow: was that recent um, and was that in line with you being a direct all the way through, including the Mexican entities, or just the intermediate holding companies. I think my impression was\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:31.469\r\nMei Mei Chow: that was a discussion he had with you some time ago. So at the moment the the Board's view is he shouldn't be on any of the direct issues,\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:38.550\r\nMei Mei Chow: if it's just the intermediate holding company. But I wanted to check with you because Sir Joe did say that he spoke to you about it,\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:48.429\r\nMei Mei Chow: so so i'll tell you why. My My conversation with them was after we discussed like a a month and a half ago, where you had in mind, and I did tell him\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:58.899\r\nMei Mei Chow: I don't want to steal your show. That was for you to to turn. You thought about with all about, you know, making it more absurd and purchase so that he's in the\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:22.430\r\nNicolas Verle: It's so that he's in the No? Okay, because he felt a bit frustrated, and and we were. We understood that he couldn't be a director. So what I told him, and that by by the way, he just ping me, and I think i'm going to see him tomorrow afternoon. So it's so, because in a moment so it's good that you and I synchronize uh our speech before. But, uh, what I told them is that I know that they may have something in mind to\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:52.040\r\nMei Mei Chow: if you in the loop of info. But I don't want to, you know. Steal May May's wind, so i'll let her discuss with you that there was never, I didn't even know that he was already a director and me to get holdings. Okay, yeah, I I And for me the discussion was all I didn't even know that it was such direct. She I mean that makes perfect sense. By the way, where I even thought about it for me the only thing that matters was cmx. And parties, and I had understood from him that he didn't want to be on the same export\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:58.880\r\nNicolas Verle: for obvious reasons. And to me the question was to get him, you know, still in death\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:28.679\r\nMei Mei Chow: in the know and the floor information of the company, which is kind of key, because I really can get very much pretty fast if you feel that you don't have to about what's going on. So I We never had any discussion at all about the intermediate directorship, now that that that that that's for sure. I know we would never dare, you know, committing to anything like that before you're mentioning it with you. The The only thing I ever told him, is, I think I may have as a solution by part to, but i'll let you die. Discuss with with with you Dark, and that that was the\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:41.860\r\nNicolas Verle: that was the ah, the you say the observer now? Ah, where I one hundred percent agree with you is that makes no sense to having a whole cascade of holding another, the last one\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:29:42.120 --> 00:30:00.789\r\nNicolas Verle: that being said, I know how he is. I know, because i'm Latin, and he's even worse because it's Mexican, and he is. He wants some sort of title or something for his resume. So he wants to be able to say somewhere they some sort of director somewhere. So\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:07.249\r\nNicolas Verle: if it's not possible, that's not possible. Thank you very much. But if's there a way, we can put in the director of something,\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.830\r\nNicolas Verle: what's your\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:28.430\r\nMei Mei Chow: great, if not well, too bad. But he doesn't want to be director at Cmx. So what's What's the issue in having him director of the whole links. What do you think? It's the issue? It just looks bad, or it's exposed. It's exposing us, or wait. Look, I understand that it looks cleaner if we remove him.\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:33.579\r\nNicolas Verle: But why? What's the danger if we keep in direct in one of the intermediary holdings?\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:45.040\r\nMei Mei Chow: Actually there, there is no danger. Right, Nicholas. So I mean we could leave it as status quo. It's just that. When we were logically looking at it. Whether it was it, it seemed odd that he was not at the top and not the bottom\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.429\r\nit. It was just a logical,\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:30:47.740 --> 00:31:02.659\r\nMei Mei Chow: a viewpoint, rather than it can't. He can't be in in the intermediate way he can, he can be kept there. Maybe we should ask him. That question is once the tax thing is solved,\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:09.580\r\nMei Mei Chow: Will he agree to be a director of Cmx in Mexico, because if that's\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:17.789\r\nNicolas Verle: that's the case, then it be the actor of all the cascade that purchase, and it's just that we're holding up from our last one.\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:27.970\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay, Now, if you're telling us. Oh, no, I don't even feel comfortable. My bad say, Okay, So you'll never be direct to of C back. So what's the point of keeping you in the holdings right?\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:47.490\r\nNicolas Verle: If it's just because you know, and and a few months will have to solve the tax thing and then you become director. Yeah, It' be stupid to remove you from the holdings, knowing very well that we're going to put you back into the final so of a whole day in a few months. But look once again I I leave it to you. It's just ideas on top of my mind.\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.460\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yes,\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:31:48.610 --> 00:32:18.429\r\nMei Mei Chow: okay. Now Then I realized today because I spoke to Sir Joe. So whenever he's not any meetings I call him and I keep him fully brief and updated, so he knows he was. He missed out on the meeting with Kpmg last Friday, and I have said to him that I will ensure that he's in this Friday. I didn't realize he was not invited because he he has to be in. I I was not controlling the the the zone calls and stuff, and I have now written an email.\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:26.690\r\nMei Mei Chow: Ah, to say, Please involve Sergio Sergio was fully involved in the sheriff's review. He should be in the kpm as well.\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.100\r\nMei Mei Chow: Um,\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:51.929\r\nMei Mei Chow: so. But I briefed him as to what happened. Ah, so he he he knows whenever he's not in a caller. I update him Now Then it it I guess it it. It became a little bit ah more obvious today. Why? Why the directorships and so forth. So whilst I was in Fouquet the last two days. There was a lot of rain and a wi-fi was cutting in and out, so\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.170\r\nMei Mei Chow: I probably didn't Yeah, I\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:32:54.180 --> 00:33:18.800\r\nMei Mei Chow: emails were coming in out it wasn't sure what I had seen or had not seen. And then I realized what I had missed was a request from Tyson to approve Sir Joe's accommodation in London, which I then said to Sergio: Today I again. I'm gonna I? I I said to your company. I want to speak to you uh, just to. So for me to understand what you understand before it happens. So\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:30.880\r\nMei Mei Chow: he's coming back to London for twenty-eight days. He's. He requested to book into a two bedroom service apartment that costs six hundred pounds a night.\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:53.810\r\nMei Mei Chow: Now his understanding is that parents would pay for it because he's here for parents, I said, Are you here on Paris's business for twenty-eight days, and then so what happened? Was you know he, the condition of him being on the parents's board was that he would be a Mexican tax resident, not a Uk tax resident. Um, now\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:33:53.820 --> 00:34:23.590\r\nMei Mei Chow: personal calls with him. He did say to me he didn't know what to do now that he wasn't in, and you know he wasn't sure the right thing to do. So I I did say to him, I said, Look, I have got. I have got a tax adviser who looks at uh individuals. I said. You know his name is. He helped me, signing whether I was a Uk tax resident or not, because I I also live, have my time in the Uk. Right? Um! And then he came and he said, Okay, this I've decided. I'm gonna stay Uk residents.\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:36.479\r\nMei Mei Chow: And this this adviser has advised me that if i'm to do that, I have to spend at least one hundred and eighty days, if not more, in the Uk. In other words, if you spend one hundred and eighty days,\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:40.020\r\nMei Mei Chow: the Uk.\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:50.710\r\nMei Mei Chow: And then you also spend a majority of your time in Mexico, but not somewhere else. Mexican might still deem that you you're trying to, so he he will. Probably you want to spend\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:34:50.719 --> 00:35:10.329\r\nMei Mei Chow: more than one hundred and eighty days in the Uk. So if the agreement was, and i'm not saying it's wrong right just. I just want to make sure we are all on the same page. If we pay for his accommodation for him to be in the Uk for more than half the year. We're talking about um. If I assume six hundred,\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:39.169\r\nMei Mei Chow: six hundred and twelve actually was what the cost. We're talking about one hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year for his accommodation. Um, which equivalent to an additional, it's basically extra ten thousand pounds a year for you. So I don't know whether you had a view about that. I mean. What I said to him was once I was working to you. I'm going to set a policy in place to make sure it's formalized. Uh, but I because he he said to me, he also spoke to you about\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:35:39.180 --> 00:36:06.300\r\nMei Mei Chow: i'll i'll. I'll tell you where is when we decided that he wouldn't be Ceo material present material, and it wouldn't basically stay in in Mexico, he said, Okay, i'm going to have to move back to London, and I can't, anyway be a Mexican resident, and it's It's partially because of practice I don't know to which extent there's some personal elements,\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:22.050\r\nMei Mei Chow: you know, like Tibet is why I think he got married recently, and his wife actually didn't want to move back to Mexico, which I can perfectly understand what. When you Australian, you marrying a guy in London, they tells you. Next thing is you moving to Mexico? You're like Well, but actually, the guy is Mexican, so that is something that was never. But\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:41.600\r\nMei Mei Chow: so what I told them is that I can't understand. There has to be a negotiation here, and that parachute will help you. But that's not for me to have a negotiation, and whatever number it is that's something that you have to agree with me. May I never agree to? I said, on the concept that there's a help. Yes, but I think it's also quite happy to move back to\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:53.000\r\nNicolas Verle: to London. So I, if you were asking me, there's no way we're paying for his life in London forever, the or half of the year that makes no sense whatsoever.\r\n\r\n195\r\n00:36:53.010 --> 00:37:04.620\r\nNicolas Verle: Now, if we're, can we help? Because we have? We're harshly responsible for that? Because we told him No, Actually, we don't need you to be an our personal guy anymore.\r\n\r\n196\r\n00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:13.449\r\nMei Mei Chow: When we agree on everything. We are very happy to have him, you know, down the ground Mexico all the time. That's why we're so happy to have it. And now we're realizing,\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:25.709\r\nMei Mei Chow: partly because of him and partly because of us. Actually he can't be in Mexico. It's a that it's actually a problem for him and us. So we're helping him to come back, because, in my my view, there's no way we're paying for everything.\r\n\r\n198\r\n00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:36.750\r\nMei Mei Chow: But we're helping, and after what's the right number? I'm not going to tell you What's the right number I won't get involved. I won't. Second, Guess you and say you'll find something that makes sense.\r\n\r\n199\r\n00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:47.289\r\nMei Mei Chow: So thank you that that that, and it helps the fact that I am hearing from you that you agreed to help. But you didn't agree to take everything, so that I just want to know where we\r\n\r\n200\r\n00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:57.290\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, Okay. Otherwise it's just the wrong incentive, because if it's everything. It's going to take the most expensive thing out there. It's like No, no, no, no! So\r\n\r\n201\r\n00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:15.500\r\nMei Mei Chow: well I that that's what worries me. I think that's a case. Look I I I mean I don't want to, you know, nickel and dime anyone I I mean I I said to surgery, I say, I live. How my life in the nature half of the Uk. I said, I don't charge by either, I said I I took on the job on the basis that I know I have to travel to Uk. Ah, I\r\n\r\n202\r\n00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:33.150\r\nMei Mei Chow: I then bought a property actually, literally recently, as as as as I joined the board, I want to. I'm not going to charge for anything apart from the affairs to go for for meetings and stuff Right So then, he said, Oh, it's different in his case, because he's doing this for parrot. And I said, you're doing this for parrot's,\r\n\r\n203\r\n00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:52.880\r\nMei Mei Chow: and and that's how the directorship came back in. He said, because i'm a director and the intermediate holding company. Ah, I've got to show that um i'm in London rather than in Mexico, and I said, So are you telling me that if you didn't have the intermediate director hips you don't\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:38:52.890 --> 00:39:01.989\r\nMei Mei Chow: you don't have. Yeah, you You know what I mean. It's it's a mix of personal and business. It's so. So it has to be a negotiation,\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:16.849\r\nNicolas Verle: and I will not. Second, guess you on whatever there is a right number. You both, and i'll tell him the tomorrow's. It's a negotiation. Characters will pick up a part of the tab a dollar, and I won't get involved in this that's between you and me.\r\n\r\n206\r\n00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:35.990\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, I i'll. I'll do that at least, I I know, and I know we we can. Uh you know I I would just find out from policy what's a fair amount, and so forth. It's like. When they asked me to approve six hundred and twelve a night for two bedroom. I I I was for twenty-eight nights. I mean My My first question was, why two bedrooms?\r\n\r\n207\r\n00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.090\r\nMei Mei Chow: I've heard this\r\n\r\n208\r\n00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:54.670\r\nMei Mei Chow: and it, and it's always the same, you know, if it were just twenty-eight days, and we never hear about it anymore, even though the the six are the great is is a lot. But you know the overall absolute. It's like ten ten years something that you know. The problem is, if we see these coming back, you know, every six months. That's a different story.\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:10.880\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yes, that's why I wanted to. Yeah, I Yeah, I I mean, I I did say that if I knew it's just twenty-eight days, I said I would have said, yes. But you know you're now telling me to be here for around two hundred days. Hold on. Yeah, yeah, it's a precedent.\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:30.469\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay, Thank you. Uh, okay, I think I'm clear on that. Now. Um, Then the next thing just two more small items uh rough file. Um. So I, Jim's also interviewed him and and liked him. So. Um, we're gonna uh uh press ahead with the\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:41.370\r\nMei Mei Chow: coming out with something for him, and let's see how the negotiations go. I did say to Raphael that it's going to happen. He's got to do it quick. The good thing about Malaysia law is\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:56.889\r\nMei Mei Chow: uh, I can't remember whether he has a he's going to check three or six months uh to um uh period uh no notification period. Uh, but I said to him, if if a small amount would you rather buy him out? So he'll start with us asap\r\n\r\n213\r\n00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:25.559\r\nMei Mei Chow: um kns um, so i've um uh told them that i'm negotiating a fee. So now they're where it's going to be nowhere, and we're gonna also talk about the sort of feature I I've said to them if they want you to what they They got to be fair with the B as well as uh as well as the amount going forward. So I I think that's going to help um. But that's that's why I want to stay with you.\r\n\r\n214\r\n00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.160\r\nTerror?\r\n\r\n215\r\n00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:41.799\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah. So let me get working on the uh the texting um, I mean, whilst i'm not happy with Kpmg's number. I think it's given us a relief that Chvis was not\r\n\r\n216\r\n00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:46.490\r\nMei Mei Chow: far out, and now we can move to the next steps.\r\n\r\n217\r\n00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.889\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah, yeah, I think we we have no choice\r\n\r\n218\r\n00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.140\r\nMei Mei Chow: as well.\r\n\r\n219\r\n00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.959\r\nNicolas Verle: Sorry\r\n\r\n220\r\n00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.190\r\nhe's been hanging over us for far too long.\r\n\r\n221\r\n00:41:54.200 --> 00:42:02.639\r\nNicolas Verle: Yeah, yeah, So let's just It's just It's just, you know. Let's let's bite the bullet on this, and after we'll see whatever we can recover from zero. We just need to.\r\n\r\n222\r\n00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:25.950\r\nNicolas Verle: They're the audit trail, because clearly you're right. Here's how we're used to the bunk advisor and everything said, Look, your advisor got us nowhere. In three years we have this over hanging our heads. So we have actually hired true advisor very well connected locally one and a great name, and they told us that so your job was just not to be done. In the first place, boom, boom! All that is in the audit trail,\r\n\r\n223\r\n00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:46.790\r\nMei Mei Chow: and we move forward because we can't afford to way right, that it's even worse than that. Cedar is actually very happy. We stole in here because Cedar Doesn't want us to sell directs. Cedral Doesn't want us to do anything serial. Just want us to keep on if they keep on keeping their fees and everything. So That's that's the problem. So they we call you just a second\r\n\r\n224\r\n00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:06.120\r\nMei Mei Chow: I'm being told. I have another meeting which is not in my schedule. So is it? Okay, if I jump, and if we can finish tomorrow morning if that's fine.\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:09.289\r\nMei Mei Chow: Yeah. No, I think that's all the things I wanted to discuss with you.\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.890\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay, perfect, perfect. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.289\r\nMei Mei Chow: Speak to it. It's up against him.\r\n\r\n228\r\n00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.679\r\nMei Mei Chow: Okay, Thank you.
