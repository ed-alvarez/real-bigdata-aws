Graham Robinson: Just chime in the respect to which of the relationships is most important in terms of the strategy that i'm sure will be helpful, with Peter and to rob.

27
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:56.400
Graham Robinson: And then you you guys if reply to this but um yeah I suppose so later than first of September is a bit of a bottleneck there for us with a few managed accounts, or rather I think she can but it's a it's a relatively large RON.

28
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.450
Graham Robinson: And it's with the opportunities to just a ton more.

29
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.830
Graham Robinson: connections and trading guys doing.

30
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.350
Peter Bremberg: Great and when you say the opportunity fund meaning it's, not just for the keel strategy.

31
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.510
Graham Robinson: it's a strategy to its.

32
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.700
Graham Robinson: event driven strategy.

33
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.850
Peter Bremberg: yeah nice congrats that's great.

34
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:30.930
Graham Robinson: yeah it's been like a year in the making, in theory, it gets funded on the first of September as past the ice, which is nice yeah crossing everything it's a relatively large amount of money so.

35
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.420
Peter Bremberg: yeah.

36
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.950
Peter Bremberg: Well we're okay being second in line we got it yeah.

37
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.560
Peter Bremberg: Because to some of the things you were mentioning first I think being set up with all.

38
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.170
Peter Bremberg: Before I go into it, or were there any other items that.

39
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:50.670
Graham Robinson: Keith.

40
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.350
I think.

41
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.660
Graham Robinson | Melqart: What we're talking about.

42
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.650
Graham Robinson: yeah okay.

43
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:56.490
Great.

44
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.490
Peter Bremberg: yeah because, because I think.

45
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:18.480
Peter Bremberg: we're on the same page, I think, for the managers were starting out with you know I would say, the number of kind of accounts or counter parties that your strategy requires is going to be over time, probably on the higher end of our initial call it six or eight managers.

46
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.420
Peter Bremberg: don't in some regards it's it's actually easier than some of the crypto strategies but.

47
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:34.650
Peter Bremberg: But in terms of is does yeah we that's been our understanding you guys have been pretty transparent about what you need for the different products, and I would ask even.

48
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:42.360
Peter Bremberg: In addition to is this Keith and I know you've mentioned to us in the past, who some of the important ones are, and I think.

49
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:57.600
Peter Bremberg: You know, timber mentioned you guys exchanged a couple couple messages about it already so we want to make sure we're prioritizing those this does that matter, but even fx prime brokerage as well, I want to make sure we're.

50
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.840
Peter Bremberg: kind of On top of that, because you would be the first manager that requires that assuming you guys require it.

51
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:15.450
Peter Bremberg: If you don't require it that's good to know if you can just trade fx with like to is to counter parties, but if you require that also like that would be a process I think we'd want to get started on our side.

52
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:16.980
Peter Bremberg: So.

53
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.640
Peter Bremberg: yeah maybe we start with that one and then we're we're happy to talk about the other points to Graham.

54
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.700
Peter Bremberg: You know timing and expenses and stuff like that.

55
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.590
Graham Robinson | Melqart: SPV is very.

56
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.230
Graham Robinson | Melqart: And kind of necessary for us.

57
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:38.550
Graham Robinson | Melqart: it's it's you know, I think, in order to get it set up fast enough, I think you know, probably be quite flexible in terms.

58
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:50.580
Graham Robinson | Melqart: and also a lot of people have gotten out of that business, so you know we sort of have to take we've got pretty lucky getting JP it's just because they give away the balance sheet for nothing but you know.

59
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.410
Graham Robinson | Melqart: Lots of places are out so.

60
00:11:52.440 --> 00:12:00.450
Graham Robinson | Melqart: I mean UBS was our other TV on the TV side, but you know they said they do it in they do, but they price it like they don't want to.

61
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:07.230
Graham Robinson | Melqart: So wherever i'm not bothered about where you, you want to end up going nevers easier for you.

62
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.780
Graham Robinson | Melqart: doesn't have to be JP.

63
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.390
Peter Bremberg: Okay.

64
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:20.040
Peter Bremberg: yeah Michael let let me know if you have any thoughts or we can we can just chat about it, I think if we're going through the.

65
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:29.700
Peter Bremberg: process with JP for is the and the next thing we're going to say was clearing like I think it makes sense for that should be our first attempt, as long as they're.

66
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:44.880
Peter Bremberg: open and willing, the only other place where our kind of day one primary kind of parties Goldman and my understanding is something they kind of fully do as a piece of broader relationship stuff so we can ask them as well.

67
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.660
Peter Bremberg: But we'll we'll start with JP if that's kind of where you guys are already working.

68
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.430
Graham Robinson | Melqart: that's kind of where we are.

69
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.850
Graham Robinson | Melqart: Probably the easier one to do if jake is a hassle.

70
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.970
Graham Robinson | Melqart: It would be someone like Barclays.

71
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.020
Graham Robinson | Melqart: yeah we'll see you soon okay so.

72
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:09.600
Peter Bremberg: Okay.

73
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.560
Peter Bremberg: So that's fx pb and and I believe clearing as well right your futures and options on futures.

74
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.060
Peter Bremberg: Do you guys clear JP today.

75
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.210
Graham Robinson | Melqart: yeah I mean we did that, because.

76
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.000
Graham Robinson | Melqart: It gave him some money.

77
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:35.820
Graham Robinson | Melqart: So we don't have to clear JP for that one of these words are unlikely to give you up expedia veto veto.

78
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.070
Peter Bremberg: Clearly, other stuff there yeah.

79
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.170
Peter Bremberg: Okay, good to know if i'm just hypotheticals.

80
00:13:46.080 --> 00:14:08.070
Peter Bremberg: If Goldman said Look, we want to do, clearing and we'll do fx pb how and assuming JP says like doing clearing and fx pb is going to for some reason that they're being difficult would golden be an okay backup I know you mentioned Barclays but just as a as we think about.

81
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:10.530
Peter Bremberg: possibility would.

82
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.680
Peter Bremberg: With any be like a showstopper there.

83
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.350
Graham Robinson | Melqart: In terms of X me.

84
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:24.300
Peter Bremberg: yeah if they were willing to do i'm not optimistic on their willingness to do i'm just thinking of giving we are doing clear we're opening futures clearing and other.

85
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:33.540
Peter Bremberg: Prime and things with Goldman right now, and so, instead of adding like another let's say like Barclays to the mix in the event JP.

86
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:45.780
Peter Bremberg: is going to be difficult or can't do it, or something like that which I have no reason to think they won't, but I just want to understand it if we could get Goldman to get there on fx pb would any reason that wouldn't work for you guys.

87
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.710
Graham Robinson | Melqart: I know.

88
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.550
That would be.

89
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:48.930
Peter Bremberg: Okay.

90
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:50.430
cool.

91
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:59.010
Peter Bremberg: um and then, as far as kind of bilateral yeah is the counter parties.

92
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.450
Graham Robinson | Melqart: I but I send you a list of.

93
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.320
Graham Robinson | Melqart: prioritizing you guys can pick and choose from what.

94
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:16.350
Peter Bremberg: Great yeah and I think if you could give us that list that's super helpful priorities and also kind of like.

95
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:25.170
Peter Bremberg: Minimum viable product like is it is it one is it too is it hopefully it's not three I don't think we'll have three by the end of September, but if you know.

96
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:35.130
Peter Bremberg: If it's like the first two, I think we could we could get to on the bilateral side and then yeah whoever the priorities are below that would you know be helpful to know.

97
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:49.320
Graham Robinson | Melqart: Our G JP and UBS would be kind of neat the problem with Goldman on the on the esters is You know, as you know, in trade, a lot of variance and they're pretty terrible at it and don't really want to do it.

98
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.350
Graham Robinson | Melqart: So if.

99
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.480
Graham Robinson | Melqart: You can try for UBS at some point, that would be helpful okay.

100
00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:58.650
and

101
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.730
Peter Bremberg: You had mentioned Barclays before i'm curious did they do.

102
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.810
Peter Bremberg: The bilateral side of the variance up as well or.

103
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:12.390
Graham Robinson | Melqart: yeah I mean we got we got the is this island in by base.

104
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.330
Graham Robinson | Melqart: With those guys we just saw with him last week.

105
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.180
Peter Bremberg: Okay that's good to know.

106
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.550
Peter Bremberg: i'm.

107
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.490
Peter Bremberg: Trying to think anything else on the kind of party side, Michael any other questions that.

108
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.540
Peter Bremberg: you've got on kind of kind of party setup I know we'll look to see the list from Keith.

109
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.290
Rob Margolis: Thank we lost Michael.

110
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:56.940
Peter Bremberg: My goals, I think, returning I don't know it looks like he's there but somehow his headset doesn't but anyway, I think we're good.

111
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.610
Peter Bremberg: So that's kind of parties and then.

112
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:14.730
Peter Bremberg: expenses that you guys as well, what do you have in mind and what we're happy to think about it and give you give you feedback.

113
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:23.280
Graham Robinson: I mean so we've done like I drove this of comprehensively get this mapped out rather than sort of you know i've had a few.

114
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:40.590
Graham Robinson: yeah we've tossed the OPS guys with with detailing the specific I suppose current expenses and obviously there is some cost to running the product as well, and the other sort of thing which we're trying to work out how we could do is, we have a.

115
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:49.050
Graham Robinson: The FC have like a sort of treating investors fairly and dynamic and so, although will be small, there are certain.

116
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:59.160
Graham Robinson: There are certain costs, I suppose, which we, as a business incurred that have to be faithfully pro rata passed through to.

117
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:13.470
Graham Robinson: To to new investors, or the new product so unfortunately emphasis, a good lesson to take on board and we will have done this differently, instead of in the language in our ppm saying.

118
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:25.620
Graham Robinson: New investors or different parts will pay the incremental costs it's a it's rather their fair share or proportion of costs and.

119
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:42.870
Graham Robinson: What I do I do rather than sort of talking hypothetical terms we do to get a number, but from infusion, unlike the specifics of that middle and back office dynamic well understand from our accounts team, you know what the.

120
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:50.010
Graham Robinson: What the title fund expenses are, or rather what the teacher firm expenses of which which.

121
00:18:51.030 --> 00:19:01.500
Graham Robinson: 10 bucks out of like 1.2 billion so receive a huge number but it's just something which we need to identify and and then we can have a more I suppose.

122
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.990
Graham Robinson: Specific chat on it.

123
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:15.210
Graham Robinson: I think yeah I do think the the frequency of the performance fee crystallization or you can help mitigate that, so I think, obviously.

124
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:29.670
Graham Robinson: To this first year or let's say I don't know exactly when we crystallize the performance i'd imagine a bit the end of this year and the year there's going to be costs involved from our side that i'm.

125
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:35.490
Graham Robinson: That we will incur and I think if we can just get this to a place where we can charge that.

126
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:49.410
Graham Robinson: Performance team of recreate that that I think massively helped just remove some of the resistance and low tech like resistance, but yeah there is some resistance operation in terms of.

127
00:19:50.880 --> 00:20:01.320
Graham Robinson: This is going to cost us in the short term yeah so Keith and myself have been working internally just find ways to sort of mitigate that push back.

128
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:02.040
Peter Bremberg: sure.

129
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.210
Graham Robinson: yeah if you.

130
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.680
Peter Bremberg: If you can share whatever.

131
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.210
Graham Robinson: Just make a proposal.

132
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.900
Peter Bremberg: And then yeah.

133
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.710
Peter Bremberg: that'd be helpful yeah that's fine because we you know.

134
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:24.840
Peter Bremberg: If something is an expense that your fund is bearing today, and I would say that the strategy I would imagine you would look at it, as if there's something that the keel fund is bearing already kind of therapists duty or mean fun.

135
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.880
Peter Bremberg: You know, we understand that and so if we need to be Perry for sue for certain expenses.

136
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.430
Peter Bremberg: Like I guess it depends what the expenses, but in general, I would say we're we're comfortable with that concept like we don't.

137
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:48.060
Peter Bremberg: Because if the way you've written your docs is your only other option is that your management company eats that expense like we understand why that that can't work for you guys so will will be very reasonable.

138
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.260
Peter Bremberg: On those types of things.

139
00:20:50.970 --> 00:21:03.060
Peter Bremberg: Obviously, if it was something that you know, is being man, it is an expense of the the I don't know if you call it the opportunity find your main fun, but doesn't really isn't really relevant for.

140
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.140
Graham Robinson: No there's no way.

141
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.630
Peter Bremberg: Like yeah exactly so.

142
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.490
Graham Robinson: So where we take Goldman Sachs Expo.

143
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.120
Peter Bremberg: Center Sir.

144
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:15.120
Peter Bremberg: yeah Now we understand and and then we'll look at it and then for frequency, so the way that we.

145
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:30.150
Peter Bremberg: Would typically do it is it's just a it's a 12 month from start date so if we did start September one or you know we can even use October one as if we start let's say mid September, and it would still be the same thing.

146
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:39.150
Peter Bremberg: So the the crystallization would be 12 months from then so August 31 would be the fiscal period.

147
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.420
Peter Bremberg: But again we're yeah.

148
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.890
Graham Robinson: Is there any flexibility in that.

149
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:51.660
Peter Bremberg: I would say that if you guys can can give us some more color on like what the issue is like we we can try to be.

150
00:21:52.860 --> 00:22:05.640
Peter Bremberg: Flexible even maybe like the first year, you know we we crystallize like half maybe not pay out the whole performance me but we crystallize like half of what you accrued after six months if that helps and.

151
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.770
Graham Robinson: yeah yeah.

152
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.160
Graham Robinson: We can be creative yeah cool.

153
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:31.410
Graham Robinson: Okay, so I mean rob what you perceive to you know intense desire so just kicking off this like plumbing conversation, as it were, and i'm also like i'm also keen, I know you guys are sort of working on that IMA side of things, you know, in our experience that's where.

154
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.240
Graham Robinson: Things should get.

155
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.640
Graham Robinson: That can be somewhat of.

156
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:45.330
Graham Robinson: A buggy part of terrain, as it were, in terms of the Maya So the sooner we can just get that to the lawyers, etc.

157
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:50.970
Peter Bremberg: yeah, I think, just to jump in for rob because we were talking about it, like, I will.

158
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.570
Peter Bremberg: If you can give us some of this more detail expense.

159
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:54.960
Graham Robinson: stuff.

160
00:22:54.990 --> 00:23:06.480
Peter Bremberg: yeah what we want to do is get you a term sheet that will have you know 80 90% of what we would consider the business terms the risk terms like the key things and we can hopefully just hammer that out in you know.

161
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.390
Peter Bremberg: i'm getting optimistic, but like get that done.

162
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:17.040
Peter Bremberg: And then hopefully by the time we we just sent back or I just sent back to our kind of internal counsel comments to the.

163
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:25.110
Peter Bremberg: The sub advisory template that we're using so we're about to send this out to yourselves and bunch of other managers and so so we're pretty close there.

164
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:33.660
Peter Bremberg: But my hope is that we get you a term sheet, we can kind of go back and forth on just making sure we're aligned on the spirit of all these kind of key areas.

165
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:45.390
Peter Bremberg: And then we'll send you the sub advisory agreement, and if you send that outside counsel naturally they're going to have to spend a lot of time and pen on it, because that's what they exist.

166
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.750
Peter Bremberg: So, so I don't know.

167
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:57.630
Peter Bremberg: How to avoid that other than if you guys have like internal resources that kind of have looked at these, and you know what actually matters for you guys and then we can be pretty efficient.

168
00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.370
Graham Robinson: Why it's a good thing.

169
00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.200
Graham Robinson: About managed account is that you know we have looked through one of these yeah.

170
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:16.380
Graham Robinson: saturated with their comparison right now so it's not a case of vendor leading a refresher I think they know where their red lines are and where you know there's a bit of.

171
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.370
Graham Robinson: friction tension, I suppose, sometimes between European or UK.

172
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.440
Graham Robinson: ways of doing things and US wording, but.

173
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:43.470
Graham Robinson: yeah we've been investigating those recently and actually as an organization as market we've released this week actually we got SEC registration so i'm not sure if it's helpful, but I think, is that it doesn't hurt right.

174
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:50.370
Peter Bremberg: Now it doesn't hurt, at the same time, like we're We obviously care about.

175
00:24:52.290 --> 00:25:00.000
Peter Bremberg: That you guys are just doing whatever you're supposed to be doing, on the Compliance side right like we care about protecting you know you're going to treat our account.

176
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:10.020
Peter Bremberg: As a fiduciary right like you treat your other accounts like your they all all the things you don't you know need tons of legal language to say, but when it comes to compliance.

177
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:18.810
Peter Bremberg: are, I think the rap we have in there is basically to the extent you're supposed to be SEC registered or the extent you're supposed to be.

178
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:27.030
Peter Bremberg: xyz registered, you are, and you comply with those rules we're not saying you have to go above and beyond what you're required because you're we're going to.

179
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:38.250
Peter Bremberg: You know play some additional burden on you, so I don't think it's too unreasonable from what i've given it's fresh in my mind I just looked at the last couple days so sure that's what it says yeah.

180
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:57.000
Graham Robinson: So then, you know, in terms of follow ups from best just so we can keep the momentum going we'll come back to you with kids you do we need to sort of establish this minimal minimum viable product in terms of that pb side of things.

181
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:04.800
Graham Robinson | Melqart: yeah I mean I think if you can somehow get us over the line that will be good enough to be pretty close to the.

182
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.710
Peter Bremberg: Okay yeah well.

183
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.620
Peter Bremberg: Whether it's.

184
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.060
Peter Bremberg: tanvir or someone on our side, I think, if you.

185
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.520
Peter Bremberg: could connect us with your because I think shared with you like, we were pretty disappointed with.

186
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:27.420
Peter Bremberg: The UBS pb in New York folks are just like their hands are completely tied like they wanted us to prime with them.

187
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:38.010
Peter Bremberg: We said okay we'll do it you'll be our second prime and then they couldn't get it over the line because of like they're like oh actually it's hard for us on board newer funds at the terms you guys want like.

188
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:45.960
Peter Bremberg: boogeyman rk goes kind of still lingering so we're like guys, we were doing this as a favor to you, and then they kind of ended up with egg on their face about a month.

189
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.170
Graham Robinson: ago.

190
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:55.200
Peter Bremberg: And so that's pb I think your business bilateral equity derivatives it's it's like a different beast and so, if there's a salesperson that you have.

191
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:12.360
Peter Bremberg: You know, we have, we have a good frankly UBS introduced standard me in the first place and Michael like they they feel pretty bad I think about how they left things, and so you know we're happy to give it another shot for you guys, but at the same time, we were.

192
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:26.700
Peter Bremberg: Like all right there's gonna be a lot of other bags we we work with before we go back to them, but it's important to you guys so we'll we'll go maybe through your relationship and see if they can just get a bilateral is done versus pb which is kind of where the business that got really.

193
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.920
Peter Bremberg: kind of harm to this my.

194
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.090
Graham Robinson | Melqart: I mean I.

195
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:37.050
Graham Robinson | Melqart: I can also look at some alternatives, I mean the goal is just to try to replicate what we have is, but it was closest.

196
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:48.780
Peter Bremberg: Oh, absolutely no, no, that we here i'm just voicing kind of like our exact UBS situation, just in case it's like again something at the 11th hour that they.

197
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:56.940
Peter Bremberg: all point to somebody that will get on the phone say why this can't you know why they need more time or why now is not the right time.

198
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:08.040
Peter Bremberg: I just don't want us to both expect yes they're going to be there and then they fade that's why I was asking about well I hear you on Goldman Okay, not a good fit, but maybe maybe Barclays and like you said they'll.

199
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:15.240
Peter Bremberg: Look at something turn around quickly, so I just want to have a backup in case CBS doesn't get it over the line in our time frame.

200
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:18.750
Graham Robinson: yeah i'm.

201
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.130
Peter Bremberg: Okay, with that i'm.

202
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.720
Peter Bremberg: Just like.

203
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:30.390
Peter Bremberg: Let me talk to Michael and Dan beer and come back to you like today Keith if it makes sense to talk to.

204
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.710
Peter Bremberg: Your your equity sales coverage, so let them kind of.

205
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.220
Peter Bremberg: push it through as hey us tell them, we have a managed account you know they're used to their credit department or.

206
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:49.350
Peter Bremberg: Whoever is probably used to that all the time, like one fun saying Oh, we have another kind of party we want to trade for, and it should hopefully not be too complicated.

207
00:28:50.040 --> 00:29:03.540
Peter Bremberg: But will check with our New York contacts and say guys, you know you ran into all these walls, you know, are we gonna run into the same thing we go through equity derivatives and and just try to avoid wasting your guys time and in our is if.

208
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:09.600
Peter Bremberg: If there's something we should just know in advance, but yeah we'll come back to really quick on that.

209
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:25.470
Graham Robinson: i'm a severe things we are you that, so I will speak to up Steve etc get color on the frequency dynamic get get the specifics on this expenses dynamic.

210
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:42.660
Graham Robinson: And as part of that you know get a get a hard number from infusion and I can maybe the fact that you guys are on infusion that number might come down a tender for some economies of scale that but, but I will get a specific i'm okay with that side tied up.

211
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:50.040
Graham Robinson: i'm Sarah anything else, which we need to get sort of rolling.

212
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.700
Peter Bremberg: No, I think that's it and I think will.

213
00:29:54.780 --> 00:30:06.450
Peter Bremberg: I think we have like the term sheet 90% there and we'll just bracket maybe expenses because or will add a line that says expenses because will input, whatever we agree on.

214
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:18.270
Peter Bremberg: But, again, there are the whole ideas with term sheet is just so there's like no surprises when we get to the the IMA for either side, like Oh, we thought you meant that we've met this.

215
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.270
Peter Bremberg: Just Britain and more plain English.

216
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.060
Graham Robinson: Enough so yeah we we.

217
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:33.300
Graham Robinson: rollin some difficulties, shall we say, and within the assumption, we made on some great and.

218
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:46.290
Graham Robinson: They were like it's That said, what we didn't assume about men anyway, so that was a lesson and so yeah I think the sooner we can just run with a few things suppose concurrently than the sooner we can get the shoulder.

219
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.510
Peter Bremberg: And, and we can I would say that.

220
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.040
You know.

221
00:30:51.150 --> 00:31:00.840
Peter Bremberg: Michael as has worked with infusion a lot in the past that was a piece of the reason why we kind of selected on as our platform kind of solution.

222
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:13.740
Peter Bremberg: So it has also will kind of be leading the integration trading risk etc with you guys so whenever you want to have a more detail call with your.

223
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.200
Peter Bremberg: Trading and operations.

224
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.030
Peter Bremberg: I think that.

225
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.500
Graham Robinson: That makes sense to do yeah that's.

226
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:32.580
Graham Robinson: cool um the other news I mean is Keith snooze I suppose i'm just the math of it but i'm Keith at the store mark he sounded like he had a stoma last month i'm not sure if you see the estimates, but.

227
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.180
Peter Bremberg: Now.

228
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.560
Graham Robinson: I don't see these guys did.

229
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.660
Peter Bremberg: 4.530 man.

230
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:38.310
Graham Robinson: yeah there is a.

231
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:39.360
Graham Robinson: shout out.

232
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.020
Graham Robinson: To Mr.

233
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.880
Graham Robinson: President and he yeah yeah.

234
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.060
Graham Robinson: So yeah those guys keep doing.

235
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.600
Graham Robinson: yeah keep on doing during the base.

236
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.590
Graham Robinson: So yeah it's it's been good to.

237
00:31:52.650 --> 00:32:04.650
Graham Robinson: Great yeah it's hard to get a definitive set of numbers from a CAP into teams about it because there's always some guy he's done some trade is up 10% of the month kind of thing, but I think on average.

238
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:19.710
Graham Robinson: You know flat ish is it's been challenging and I think a few of the Central Bank moves around the world, definitely refer to the few mark refunds so thankfully, and will continue to differentiate ourselves yeah.

239
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.620
Peter Bremberg: No doubt and that's that we're making.

240
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.450
Peter Bremberg: I wish I wish we could buy the July one now.

241
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.170

Graham Robinson: And maybe.

246
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:56.940
Graham Robinson: Maybe I don't know we try and speak at the end of week or this by this time next week, just to check in on Paris action points and work streams.

247
00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:58.770
