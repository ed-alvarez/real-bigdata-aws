        PDF Attached w/Detailed Rates


        Tankers: VLCC earnings were assessed at $279,400 per day on Friday. Suezmaxes are now $117,600/day, up 73% on
        the day. Compared with October 2019 when the market was jolted when 5% of the fleet was removed (COSCO
        sanctions) and charterers panicked and rates were unsustainable high, this time around it’s fundamentally
        supported by an at least 3.5 mb/day increase in Middle East output during April, which will tie up 80 VLCCs
        assuming an average 6,000 nautical mile voyage. However, as noted in our Shipping Weekly, approximately 10 VLCCs
        are heading for the US Gulf which is more than 12,000 nautical miles. We assess fleet capacity utilization is
        now close to 100%. This means that only refining margins will limit the potential upside. Fortunately, the way
        Saudi Arabia prices their oil (a fixed $10/bbl discount to whatever Brent is for European customers), this means
        for every dollar Brent drops, and product prices are unchanged, the freight component can increase by $35,000
        per day. Although we are certainly at very high levels, the market could continue to go higher in the short
        term, we argue. This could last as long as Saudi Arabia keeps up its current price policy, and the next
        scheduled price change is April 5th for May sales prices. Even if rates correct from April onward, the current
        strong rates are likely to result in 2Q20 showing the highest quarterly earnings since at least 2Q 2008.

        LNG: Brokers marked up LNG headline rates to (TFDE) $38,500/day on Friday from $34,500/day last week. MEGI/XDF
        ships were assessed at $49,000/day. As before, considerable waiting time means actual earnings are lower, with
        the round voyage TFDE assessments in the $15,000-$24,000/day range. Brokers noted that activity picked up due to
        more US Gulf cargoes for April. The rate increase reflects mostly that owners have pushed ballast bonuses
        higher, which is needed to get ships positioned into the Atlantic. Sentiment appears steady in the Far East with
        decreasing availability of tonnage. Interest for period coverage remains high with charterers willing to take
        ships ahead of Winter 2020/21. The current 3-6 month charters also inched up $5,000/day on the week to
        $45,000/day for TFDE and $60,000/day for 2-stroke vessels.

        Dry Bulk: There weren’t major changes to headline Capesize rates which the Baltic Exchange put at $2,800/day.
        However, as pointed out previously, we believe the real earnings are better reflected in the round voyage spot
        rates from Brazil and Australia to China which are currently at $5,800/day and $4,200/day, respectively, when
        assuming slower sailing speeds. The FFA markets are trading down 11% this morning with Capesize April contracts
        now at $4,600/ day. 2Q20 contracts are trading at $7,300/day, 3Q20 at $12,400/day and 4Q20 at $14,800/day.
